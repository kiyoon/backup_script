# List of directories to backup, by Kiyoon's back up script.
# All of them should be absolute path, like /home/user
# Backup these directories but exclude from "backup_exclude" list
#

# Tip: Consider adding dot(.) in the path to indicate from which the relative structure should begin.
# e.g. /var/spool/cron/crontabs    -> Make the entire directory in the destination backup folder,             like /path/to/backup/folder/backup_0/var/spool/cron/crontabs/[FILES]
#      /var/spool/cron/./crontabs  -> Consider root directory as "crontabs" in the destination folder,        like /path/to/backup/folder/backup_0/crontabs/[FILES]
#      /var/spool/cron/crontabs/./ -> The files in the directory will be copied directly to the destination folder, like /path/to/backup/folder/backup_0/[FILES]
